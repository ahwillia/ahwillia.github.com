    I like the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science" target="_blank">open notebook science</a>, so this is my attempt at it.
  </p>
  <p>
  	I will periodically upload simple models and simulations here: <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ahwillia/notebooks/tree/master/code_pubs/" target="_blank">nbviewer directory</a>. Entries are organized by date, and each file should be self-contained with code and explanatory notes.
  </p>
  <p>
  	If you are happy to deal with chaos, feel free to sift through all my notebooks in <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ahwillia/notebooks/tree/master/" target="_blank">this directory</a>.
