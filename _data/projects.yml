- title: Unsupervised Learning Techniques for Neural Data
  description: >
    Neuroscientists use "off-the-shelf" unsupervised techniques to make sense of their data
    and gain intuition about their experimental system. Doing this is extremely necessary
    given the explosion and growth of datasets, but also involves a lot of choices and
    qualitative interpretation that reasonable experts may disagree on.

    description: >
      Commonly used methods for dimensionality reduction identify low-dimensional features of
      within-trial neural dynamics, but do not model changes in neural activity across trials.
      To better understand processes like learning and trial-to-trial variability, I'm
      explorting techniques like tensor decompositions to find reduced representations of
      multi-trial datasets.

    description: >
      Neuroscientists use clustering algorithms to categorize neurons and glia into functional
      and genetic cell types. While the idea of cannonical cell types is empirically useful
      for building models and experimental tools, it is unclear how the choice of clustering
      algorithm impacts our understanding of the brain. I'm interested in situations where
      clusterings can be found with provable guarantees.

  #   description: >
  #     Dimensionality reduction is another common (and related) class of techniques commonly
  #     used by neuroscientists and biologists. I'm interested in developing and applying
  #     extensions of principal components analysis (PCA) that are tailored to the particulars
  #     of biological data.

- title: Theoretical Molecular Neurobiology
  description: >
    Biology computes with both electrical and biochemical signals. I'm interested in modeling
    the interface of these two substrates of computation.

    description: >
      Neurons alter ion channel and synaptic receptor expression/activity to maintain activity
      levels in physiologically stable regimes. This can be modeled from a control theoretic
      perspective, which provides perspectives on how noisy molecular processes can nevertheless
      support reliable physiological behaviors.

    description: >
      Neurons are remarkably complex cells. Given this, it seems an almost insurmountable challenge
      to transport molecular cargo reliably. I've studied a few simple models of how reliable
      transport can be accomplished.
