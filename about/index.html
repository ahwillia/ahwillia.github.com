    As of September 2015, I am a PhD student in Neuroscience at Stanford University. I am interested in a broad class of theoretical (and a few computational) problems related to Biology. I work in <a href="http://ganguli-gang.stanford.edu/index.html" target="_blank">Surya Ganguli's group</a>.

    I was previously a student at UC San Diego and a research technician at Brandeis University. I obtained my undergraduate degree from Bowdoin College. I am very grateful to have worked under some excellent mentors:
