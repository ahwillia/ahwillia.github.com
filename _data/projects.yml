- title: Unsupervised Learning Techniques for Large-Scale, Multi-Trial Neural Data
  description: >
    A common paradigm in systems neuroscience is to simultaneously record the
    activity of many neurons over repeated experimental trials (e.g., multiple
    presentations of a sensory stimulus, or a repeated motor action). The resulting
    datasets can be very large, potentially containing recordings from thousands of
    neurons over thousands of experimental trials.
    I'm interested in finding general-purpose statistical approaches for understanding
    datasets of this form.

      Analysis of neural data often relies on manual alignment of neural activity to
      a stimulus or behavioral event on each trial. However, alignment to external events
      is not always possible (e.g., in cases where neural activity is locked to internal
      cognitive states or decisions). I'm working to develop automatic alignment methods
      for these cases, enabling discovery of otherwise hidden neural coding patterns.

      Commonly used methods for dimensionality reduction (such as <a
      href="http://alexhwilliams.info/itsneuronalblog/2016/03/27/pca/" target="_blank">PCA</a>)
      identify low-dimensional features of within-trial neural dynamics, but do not model
      changes in neural activity across trials. To better understand processes like learning
      and trial-to-trial variability, I'm exploring <a

      tensor decomposition methods</a> to find reduced representations of multi-trial datasets.

      Many animal behaviors are built as a sequence of motor primitives or decisions. The
      neurons that support these (and other) behaviors can also fire in repeatable sequences.
      Yet, statistical methods for identifying neural sequences in an unbiased manner
      (without pre-conceived reference to animal behavior) are not widely used. I am interested
      in using convolutive matrix factorization methods to address this problem.

    Biology computes with both electrical and biochemical signals. In past work, I studied
    how these two substrates of computation interact with each other.

      Neurons are remarkably complex cells. Given this, it seems an almost insurmountable challenge
      to transport molecular cargo reliably. I studied a few simple models of how reliable
      transport can be accomplished.
