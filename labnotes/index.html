    I like the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science" target="_blank">open notebook science</a>, so this is my attempt at it.
  </p>
  <p>
  	I will periodically upload simple models and simulations here: <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ahwillia/notebooks/tree/master/code_pubs/" target="_blank">nbviewer directory</a>. Entries are organized by date, and each file should be "self-contained" with code and explanatory notes.
  </p>
  <p>
  	I will also periodically sketch out my projects/thoughts in a lab diary, which you can find <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ahwillia/notebooks/tree/master/lab_notebook/" target="_blank">in this nbviewer directory</a>. This may be less useful and will definitely be less polished than the code posted to the first link, above.
