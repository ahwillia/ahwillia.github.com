- title: Principled Unsupervised Learning Techniques in Neuroscience
  description: >
    Neuroscientists use "off-the-shelf" unsupervised techniques to make sense of their data
    and gain intuition about their experimental system. Doing this is extremely necessary
    given the explosion and growth of datasets, but also involves a lot of choices and
    qualitative interpretation that reasonable experts may disagree on. What statistical
    methods, techniques, and philosophies should we adopt to encourage transparency and
    consistency across research groups?

    description: >
      Neuroscientists use clustering algorithms to categorize neurons and glia into functional
      and genetic cell types. While the idea of cannonical cell types is empirically useful
      for building models and experimental tools, it is unclear how the choice of clustering
      algorithm impacts our understanding of the brain. I'm interested in situations where
      clusterings can be found with provable guarantees.

      Dimensionality reduction is another common (and related) class of techniques commonly
      used by neuroscientists and biologists. I'm interested in developing and applying
      extensions of principal components analysis (PCA) that are tailored to the particulars
      of biological data.

    I've written a few packages in Julia for statistics and optimization applications.
    Some of these are still works in progress or under active development.
