- title: Unsupervised learning methods for large-scale, multi-trial neural data
  description: >
    A common paradigm in systems neuroscience is to simultaneously record the
    activity of many neurons over repeated experimental trials (e.g., multiple
    presentations of a sensory stimulus, or a repeated motor action). The resulting
    datasets can be very large, potentially containing recordings from thousands of
    neurons over thousands of experimental trials. I'm interested in finding
    general-purpose statistical approaches for understanding datasets of this form. See

- title: Automated segmentation and detection of motifs in high-dimensional time series
  description: >
    Trial-structured data (described above) are convienent for data analysis---in particular,
    if neural dynamics on different trials follow a similar (though not identical) trajectory,
    we can build a model that isolates this structure while discarding the remaining "noise"
    (for lack of a better term). A more challenging problem is how to extract scientifically
    interpretable features from unstructured neural and behavioral data streams (e.g. during
    unconstrained natural behaviors). I am working on models that extract temporal motifs
    or pseudo-trials from these unannotated time series. See
