  <p id="bodypara">
    I became seriously interested in neuroscience when I was in high 
    school. Its a condition that probably traces back to my parents - 
    both of whom are psychologists. So, like any normal kid, I grew up
    reading a lot of Steven Pinker, Noam Chomsky, and Psych 101
    textbooks. I attended Bowdoin College from 2008-2012. I was
    initially interested in pursuing a Psych major, but ended up falling
    in love with computational modeling. </p>

    Currently, I work as a research technician in Eve Marder's lab at
    Brandeis University. Eve and Patsy both work on small invertebrate
    networks involved in simple, rhythmic motor behaviors (e.g.
    chewing). My work mostly examines how neurons maintain stable 
    activity patterns over long time periods, when the proteins (e.g.
    ion channels) that determine neuronal activity are produced and
    degraded on much quicker time scales. </p>

    In my spare time I like to run, hike, and shoot hoops. If I ever
    moved to California, I would be interested in learning how to surf.
