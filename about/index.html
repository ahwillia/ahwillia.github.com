    I am currently a PhD student in Neuroscience at UC San Diego, funded
    through the <a href="http://www.krellinst.org/csgf/"
    target="_blank">DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellowship Program</a>.
    Previously, I was a research technician in
    <a href="http://blogs.brandeis.edu/marderlab/">Eve Marder's Lab</a>
    at Brandeis University, where I worked on

    <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24133260" target="_blank">variability</a>
    in the effects of neuromodulators on invertebrate circuits. I
    recieved my Bachelor's degree from Bowdoin College; I completed a
    senior <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23446690" target="_blank">thesis</a>
    in Patsy Dickinson's lab on a computational model of the cardiac CPG
    in lobsters.</p>

    In my spare time I like to run, hike, and play pickup basketball and
    soccer. I am also writing a open-access online textbook on
    computational neuroscience (www.Neuro101.com). The first few
    chapters have been completed and will be uploaded soon.
