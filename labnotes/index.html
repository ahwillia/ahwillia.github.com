    I like the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science" target="_blank">open notebook science</a>, so this is my attempt at it. In an attempt to keep things organized, I may limit myself to one entry a week.

  	My lab notebook entries are organized chronologically by date here: <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ahwillia/notebooks/tree/master/lab_notebook/" target="_blank">nbviewer directory</a>
