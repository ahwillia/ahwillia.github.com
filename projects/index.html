    Neuronal function is largely determined by the expression of
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel" target="_blank">
    ion channel proteins</a>. There are a 
    <a href="http://channelpedia.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">
    large number
    </a>
    of ion channel proteins, each with distinct biophysical
    properties. The problem for a neuron is this: ion channels are
    produced and degraded in a stochastic and noisy manner, but the
    neuron must maintain appropriate electrical properties for the
    brain to function properly. Eve has given
    <a href="http://www.brandeis.edu/bnc/philanthropy/science-news.html" target="_blank">
    a great analogy
    </a> 
    for this:
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em;font-size:18px">
    "[Ion channels] last only for weeks, days or sometimes
    hours, so every single neuron has to constantly replace every
    single protein. So if you look at a 98-year-old, he or she
    replaced every single kind of ion channel thousands and thousands
    of times. That's equivalent to, for example, taking a 777 airplane
    and replacing every single component while it's flying, without
    showing disruption of function!"

  <p>
	Neurons achieve this amazing feat by
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis" target="_blank">
    homeostatically</a>
    tuning their expression of ion channels, which has given rise to
    the field of
    <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Homeostatic_Regulation_of_Neuronal_Excitability" target="_blank">
    neuronal homeostasis</a>.

	<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11224547" target="_blank">studies</a>
	have developed computational models of homeostatic channel

	<a href="http://blogs.brandeis.edu/marderlab/members/dr-timothy-oleary/" target="_blank">Tim O'Leary</a>
	in the Marder Lab to examine the common principles of these
	different models, and develop new biologically plausible models.
	One of our findings is that many different homeostatic rules can
	be designed to produce similar neuronal function. Additionally,
	one may be able to determine the form of these homeostatic rules
	in biological data by examining the

  <p>
    While much is known about vertebrate motor systems, invertebrate
    model organisms present the best opportunity to dissect the
    functions of individual neurons, neuromodulators, and muscle
    groups. More specifically, simple invertebrate systems such as the
    <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Aplysia_feeding_biomechanics" target="_blank">Aplysia feeding network</a>,
    the crustacean <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Stomatogastric_ganglion" target="_blank">stomatogastric ganglion</a>,
    and the crustacean <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11971808" target="_blank">heart</a>
    have been mapped in exquisite detail by decades of research (thanks
    to their relative anatomical simplicity). We know, for example,
    that the heart of the American lobster (<i>H. americanus</i>) is
    rhythmically stimulated by exactly 5 motor neurons in every
    preparation, and that these motor neurons are solely responsible
    for heart contractions. We can therefore ask a specialized set of
    questions in this system:
  </p>
    <li id="small_list">
      How does the neural activity of these 5 cells translate into muscle activity?
    </li>
    <li id="small_list">
      How direct or straightforward is this transformation?
    </li>
    <li id="small_list">
      What other factors (e.g. temperature, or biological signals) influence the neuromuscular interface?
    </li>
    <li id="small_list">
      How variable is neural activity across preparations? To what extent does this correlate with variability in muscle activity?
    </li>
  <p>
    Some of these questions have been previously studied in a
    theoretical context (for example, Brezina et al.
    <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10634868" target="_blank">2000a</a>,
    <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10634869" target="_blank">2000b</a>,
    <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10634870" target="_blank">2000c</a>).
    I am examining the extent to which these current theories capture
    experimental reality by simultaneously measuring baseline neural
    activity and muscle behavior across many different preparations.
