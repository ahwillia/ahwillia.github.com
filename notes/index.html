  <p>
    I want to use this page as a resource for undergrads who are
    interested in computational neuroscience. Below are some sources
    of information that you may find interesting/helpful.

    It is obviously important to read primary research papers that
    are specific to the topics you are interested in. Below are some
    papers that give an overview of the field of computational
    neuroscience, as well as it's history, and culture.

	  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18995824" target="_blank">Theoretical Neuroscience Rising</a>
	</li> 
	LF Abbott (2008). Neuron. 60(3):489-95. </b><br>
	"Theoretical neuroscience is sometimes criticized for not 
    making enough predictions... To apply prediction as the ultimate
    test of a theory is a distortion of history. Many of the most
    celebrated moments in quantitative science — the gravitational
    basis of the shape of planetary orbits, the quantum basis of the
    spectrum of the hydrogen atom, and the relativistic origin of the
    precession of the orbit of Mercury — involved postdictions of
    known and well-characterized phenomena."

	W Gerstner, H Sprekeler, G Deco (2012). Science. 338(6103):60-5</b><br>
	"Modern neuroscience methods requiring extensive training have led
	to a specialization of researchers, such that neuroscience today 
	is fragmented into labs working on genes and molecules, on 
	single-cell electrophysiology, on multineuron recordings, and on 
	cognitive neuroscience and psychophysics, to name just a few. One
	of the central tasks of computational neuroscience is to bridge 
	these different levels of description by simulation and 
	mathematical theory."

	"Ideally one would want to promote stronger interaction between
	the two fields and increased awareness of each other's strengths,
	i.e., by organizing joint meetings. But at present it seems there
	is... little interest in the respective communities for such
	initiatives. In part, this reflects different interests, e.g.,
	system biologists often see computational neuroscience work as
	too specialized, while many computational neuroscientists have
	little interests in genes and molecules."

        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/compneuro" target="_blank">Computational Neuroscience</a>
      </b></i></li> 
       Especially good lectures on Bayesian inference and linear-nonlinear
       models. Some mathematics background will be useful.
      <br><br>
      <li><i><b>
        <a href="http://lcn.epfl.ch/~gerstner/VideoLecturesGerstner.html" target="_blank">Neural Networks and Biological Modeling</a>
      </b></i></li> 
       This very nice set of lectures by Wulfram Gerstner complements
       the above course by Fairhall and Rao. The first part of the course
       on single neuron models is particularly essential and well-introduced.
       Prof. Gerstner is also offering a similar 
       <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/epfl/bio465x/neuronal-dynamics-computational/1024" target="_blank">course on edX</a>.
      <br><br>
      <li><i><b>
        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/compmethods" target="_blank">Computational Methods for Data Analysis</a>
      </b></i></li>
       This course is excellent. As the title suggests, the course is
       not limited to the field of neuroscience, but all of the material
       is incredibly important and relevant: Time-Frequency analysis, principal
       components analysis (and SVD), independent component
       analysis (ICA), and more.

	  <li><i><b> Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience </b></i></li><br>
	  <img src="/img/dyn_sys_book.jpg" id="bookimg">
	  <p>
        This book is an excellent starting point for those who are
		interested in learning some basic mathematical analysis of
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_systems_theory" target="_blank">
		dynamical systems.</a> Izhikevich focuses on single-compartment
		<a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Conductance-based_models" target="_blank">
		conductance-based</a> models of individual neurons, providing
		an excellent foundation for understanding all neural systems.
		(Prerequisites: some linear algebra, experience with ODEs).

	  <br>
	  <li><i><b> An Introduction to Systems Biology </b></i></li><br>
	  <img src="/img/uriBook_cover.jpg" id="bookimg">
	  <p style="margin-top:0">
	    While this book mentions neuronal networks, the primary focus is
	    on the dynamics of
	    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_regulatory_network" target="_blank">
		transcriptional networks</a> in <i>E. coli</i>. But this is
		nevertheless one of my favorite books. Uri Alon outlines
		many basic theoretical principles to describe the
		<i>E. coli</i> system, and describes carefully designed
		experiments that validate these models. Alon's highly
		successful approach to systems biology should be more widely
		appreciated in the neuroscience community. Also see
		Uri Alon's 
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z__BHVFP0Lk" target="_blank">
		online lectures.</a> (Prerequisites: None)
	  </p>
      <li><i><b> Theoretical Neuroscience </b></i></li><br>
      <img src="/img/theor_neuro.jpg" id="bookimg">
	  <p>
	    This is a classic graduate-level textbook that covers both
		analytical and computational modeling techniques in a
		diverse number of neural systems. If you are serious about
		computational neuroscience, you will need to read this book
		at some point. But be warned, it can be dense.
		(Prerequisites: A class in neurophysiology, linear algebra,
		and differential equations).
	  </p> <br>
	  <li><i><b> Applied Linear Regression Models </b></i></li><br>
	  <img src="/img/lin_reg_book.jpg" id="bookimg">
	  <p style="margin-top:0">
	    If you want to do any work with experimental data, you need
		to learn statistics on a <b><i>deep</i></b> mathematical
		level. This book was required reading for one of my
		undergraduate statistics courses, and I found it
		particularly helpful. There are undoubtedly other books you
		could use to this end, but this is the text I have
		experience with and it is didactically sound. You can also
		look into <i>Biostatistical Analysis</i> by Jerold Zar - it
		is a <b><i>great</i></b> textbook for reference, but a dry
		read. (Prerequisites: a class in probability/statistics,
		linear algebra, experience with R).
