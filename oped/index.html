  <div id="pagetitle"> Things I Feel Strongly About </div>
  <p>
    As an ex-high school debater, I cannot pass up the opportunity to
    throw my personal opinions up on the web. I believe that scientists
    should engage in social/political/cultural discourse to a greater
    extent, so here are my two cents.
  </p>
  <div id="bodypara"><b>People need to understand what scientific innovation can bring us in the near future</b></div>
  <p>
	Neil deGrasse Tyson is fond of saying that Americans have
	"<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbIZU8cQWXc" target="_blank">stopped dreaming</a>."
	I strongly support space exploration and restoring proper levels of
	funding to NASA, but I think it is more important that scientists
	extend this message to encompass other areas of research. In
	short, biology and neuroscience need a Neil deGrasse Tyson.

	I would love it if
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil" target="_blank">
	Ray Kurzweil</a>, and
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey" target="_blank">
	Aubrey de Grey</a> were to become household names. (Even though they
	are a bit crazy.)

  <div id="bodypara"><b>The "Liberal bias" of academia</b></div>
  <p>
    While I was an undergraduate at Bowdoin College, I got involved in
    a debate with Thomas Klingenstein from the Claremont Institute
    over the apparent "liberal bias" of academia (see 
    <a href="http://bowdoinorient.com/article/6353" target="_blank">this article</a>
    for background; Mr. Klingenstein's original article can be found
    <a href="http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.1800/article_detail.asp" target="_blank">here</a>;
    and my co-authored response can be found
    <a href="http://bowdoinorient.com/article/6383" target="_blank">here</a>).
    The debate generated a year-long study by the
    <a href="http://www.nas.org/" target="_blank">National Association of Scholars</a> (NAS).
    In April 2013, NAS published their report "The Bowdoin Project" 
    <a href="http://www.nas.org/projects/the_bowdoin_project/" target="_blank">online</a>.

  <div id="bodypara"><b>Every Neuroscientist Should Sign This</b></div>
  <p>
    Prof. Curtis Bell (U Oregon) has written a pretty awesome pledge that
    all neuroscientists should consider signing. There is a very real
    possibility for neuroscience research to be applied to enhance torture
    techniques, and we should all be aware of this. Read more here:
    <a href="http://neuroethicscanada.wordpress.com/2010/01/05/a-conversation-on-the-neuroethics-of-war/" target="_blank">[link]</a>.
    As a side note, Curtis Bell is an amazing scientist - you should read
    some of his papers.
